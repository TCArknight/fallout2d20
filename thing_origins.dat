  <thing id="spcBrotherIni" name="Brotherhood Initiate" description="Born from the terrible revelations of the Mariposa Rebellion, Roger Maxson formed the Brotherhood of Steel so that his people—and eventually the rest of the survivors in this new world—would have something to believe in. With its own mythology, creed, and hierarchy, the Brotherhood of Steel’s primary goal is the recovery and preservation of the technology of the pre-war world. With the Great War disrupting humanity’s access to technology, the Brotherhood’s knights and scribes do all they can to secure the technology of the past, for the needs of future generations.\n\nYou may be a descendant of a knight or paladin, born into the Brotherhood and a firm believer of their doctrine, or you may be a new recruit, pledging yourself to their cause and looking to rise through their ranks.\n\nAlthough the Brotherhood share a common goal, their chapters across the wasteland can have different beliefs and protocols, and they aren’t as unified as they seem from the outside. While the West Coast Brotherhood of Steel warred with the New California Republic over reclamation of technology and the NCR’s expansion efforts, the East Coast chapter was effectively isolated when it prioritized charity over the exchange of technology and the preservation of pre-war equipment. Elder Lyons’ mission became humanitarian, and while that earned them isolation at first, Arthur Maxson led their expansion of influence from Washington D.C. to the entire Eastern Seaboard, refocusing their efforts on technological recovery and development." compset="Origin" uniqueness="unique">

  <thing id="spcGhoul" name="Ghoul" description="Prolonged exposure to the effects of background gamma radiation—part of the fallout of the Great War—can spontaneously mutate humans. You are one of those mutants. Either slowly, or strangely spontaneously, your body changed into that of a rotting, living corpse. You no longer age the same way, and appear unaffected by radiation. Your skin peels from your flesh but seems to be sustained by your mutated metabolism.\n\nYou are a “ghoul”—a necrotic post-human—one of many rag-tag survivors who weren’t lucky enough to get into a Vault-Tec facility. You may have been born after the war, and over time developed the necrotic mutation. You may have come from Vault 12 in Bakersfield, California, whose vault door did not close, exposing the population to the radiation from outside. You may have taken refuge in a ghoul settlement, like Underworld in the Capital Wasteland, and have ventured out recently to explore, scavenge, and survive.\n\nCivilized ghouls, such as yourself, also fear a possible degeneration into a frenzied, feral nature. Feral ghouls are necrotic mutants like yourself who have lost higher brain functions, and reverted to a primal, violent state. They attack non-ghouls indiscriminately to defend their territory or feed. Whether this loss of reason is due to acute levels of radiation or the inevitable outcome of the mutation, you’re not sure, and that makes it all the more terrifying." compset="Origin" uniqueness="unique">

Infected with the Forced Evolutionary Virus (F.E.V.), your body has mutated into a tall, muscular killing machine, filled with a rage.\n\nYou could have originated from the Master’s army at the Mariposa military base, California, created as he experimented on unwilling human victims, splitting into one of the factions upon his death to attack or rebuild the wasteland with its survivors. Your origins could be rooted in the Evolutionary Experimentation Program of Vault 87, whose super mutant groups terrorize the Capital Wasteland. You could have been abducted from the Commonwealth and exposed to the F.E.V. by the Institute and disposed of back into the wasteland to fend for yourself in small bands of raiders. Or finally, you could have been a resident of Huntersville, Appalachia, whose water supply was contaminated with the virus and the mutations went unchecked.\n\nAlthough these super mutants share the same qualities, the groups formed from the three strains haven’t mixed, and there is little evidence they have met one another. While some groups have migrated or moved in their lifetime, none have travelled far enough to encounter one another, so where your quests take place will likely dictate your origin." compset="Origin" uniqueness="unique">

Formed from the political differences and exodus of Vault 15 in California, its founding members left the vault with a G.E.C.K., allowing them to grow food, build their first amenities, and establish Shady Sands. Soon, a thriving, self-sustaining community became the foundation stone of the New California Republic, or NCR. From its humble beginnings, the NCR expanded, promoting many old-world values: democracy, with its presidents and a Congress; liberty, by exalting personal freedoms; and the rule of law, by protecting its citizens and holding them accountable for immoral actions. Whether you live these values yourself is up to you, but if you come from New California, your life is marked by it in some way.\n\nMany citizens of the republic are just like survivors you’d find anywhere in the wastes: farmers, herders, mechanics, merchants, caravaneers, even mercenaries and soldiers. What sets you apart are the cultural touchstones other wastelanders don’t have in their everyday lives. The NCR Dollar, established at the turn of the 22nd century, dominates the New California economy and eclipses Nuka-Cola bottle caps as the default tender within NCR territory. You’ll likely have seen much more built-up urban areas, like the Hub, Junktown, Vault City, and New Reno. These sprawling urban centers make the rest of the wasteland seem backward, deserted, and otherwise dangerous. The trade pouring in and out of these settlements provides food, medicine, and even civil liberties like the right to vote and to pursue justice for crimes committed. That being said, a strain on the agricultural and industrial output of the republic has driven an expansion east, into the Mojave Wasteland in particular, to find and develop more farmland. The ensuing annexations, wars, and expansion to the NCR’s territory brought arguments of imperialism against its government, and its thinly-stretched military and prospecting frontiersmen lost the benefits of civilization for the benefit of everyone else." compset="Origin" uniqueness="unique">
